## 📊 KPIs Visualized

- **Total Surgeries Performed** (per urgency level & year)  
- **Median Wait Time for Surgery** (days)  
- **% Patients Treated Within Recommended Time** (with overall compliance gauge)  
- Trend comparisons **2018–2023** across urgency categories  

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- **Urgent surgeries** maintained **100% on-time treatment** across all years.  
- **Semi-urgent and non-urgent** categories saw sharp declines in on-time performance during 2020–21, coinciding with COVID-19 restrictions.  
- **Non-urgent wait times** peaked at over **220 days in 2020** before declining but remain above pre-pandemic levels.  
- Year-on-year improvements in 2022–23 suggest recovery but gaps remain in lower-priority categories.
